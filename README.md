## About this repo
Code for modelling and analysis of tennis matches
## Agenda for future work
- [x] ensure that the `match_num` variable in `match.data` is correctly ordering matches. Use round data or winner/loser data to check this
- [x] fix the `play.tiebreak function` so it can handle being run from the middle of a tiebreak
- [] look at match win percentages based on % of points won on serve / return. Compare the theoretical results from a model to match data
- [] how much do different seeds tend to benefit from being seeded?
- [] simulate a selection of matches to work out the least likely comebacks in history
- [] what determines the length of a match? split into long points vs long games vs long sets vs long matches. How strong is the effect for a selection of matches?
