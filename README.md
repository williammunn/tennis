# About this repo
Code for modelling and analysis of tennis matches
# Agenda for future work
1. ~~ensure that the `match_num` variable in `match.data` is correctly ordering matches. Use round data or winner/loser data to check this~~
2. fix the `play.tiebreak function` so it can handle being run from the middle of a tiebreak
3. look at match win percentages based on % of points won on serve / return. Compare the theoretical results from a model to match data
4. how much do different seeds tend to benefit from being seeded?
5. simulate a selection of matches to work out the least likely comebacks in history
6. what determines the length of a match? split into long points vs long games vs long sets vs long matches. How strong is the effect for a selection of matches?
