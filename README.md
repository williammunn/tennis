Code for modelling and analysis of tennis matches
# Agenda for future work
1. ensure that the match_num variable in match.data is correctly ordering matches. Use round data or winner/loser data to chek this
2. look at match win percentages based on % of points won on serve / return. Compare the theoretical results from a model to match data
3. how much do different seeds tend to benefit from being seeded?
4. simulate a selection of matches to work out the least likely comebacks in history
5. what determines the length of a match? split into long points vs long games vs long sets vs long matches. How strong is the effect for a selection of matches?
